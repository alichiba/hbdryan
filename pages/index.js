            Hope you have a happy 20th birthday! <br/>Last year, I was up early in the morning to &quot;make&quot; you a birthday website for fun cause I thought you might like it. Now that we&apos;re together and I have a feeling we will be celebrating together much more so I thought why not keep the idea going. I have gotten much better at making websites now too, which is in part thanks to you! You are so amazing and I am very grateful to have met you and become as close as we are because you have brought me a lot of happiness. I think you are very special and I hope all your aspirations come true in the future cause you deserve it :) Enjoy being in your twenties and all your upcoming adventures! 
            <br/><br/>Love, Alison &lt;3</p>
